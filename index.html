                            <p>Lab 1 was split into two main sections, the configuration of the Artemis board and programming the connevtivity between the laptop and the Arthemis board via Bluetooth. As part of Lab 1A, we went through simple builtin examples to examine the funcationalities of the Arthemis board and finished off by programming the board to recognize the musical "C" note. In Lab 1B, after setting up the environment such as installing the right python and jupyter lab versions, a total of 8 Tasks not including the extra 5000 level task were completed step by step.</p>

                            <p>Since I used a windows laptop to complete the labs, it was relatively straight forward to setup the Arduino IDE and install the Sparkfun Apollo3 Arduino Core from the official sparkfun website by using the json file method. </p>
                            <h4>Task 1</h4>
                            <p>Task 1 was simply connecting the Arthemis board to the laptop which was easy enough without encountering any issues after identifying and selecting the correct port and board from board manager.</p>
                            <h4>Task 2</h4>
                            <p>In Task 2, the built-in blink example was ran and tested. The program was compiled and uploaded onto the board.</p>

                            <h4>Task 3</h4>
                            <p>In Task 3, the example code Example4_Serial from Apollo3 was compiled and uploaded onto the board to demonstrate that the serial monitor is functional. Keep in mind the the serial monitor's baud rate had to be set to the same value as shown in the code or else it is not able to recognize the characters.</p>

                            <h4>Task 4</h4>
                            <p>Then, the example code Example2_analogRead was uploaded to test the onboard temperature sensor. By placing a bit of pressure on the sensor, the counts would slowly increase demonstrating that the temperature was increasing. There is a shield on top of the sensor so it was not very accurate.</p>

                            <h4>Task 5</h4>
                            <p>In Task 5, in order to test the microphone on the board, the example PDM was ran. The video shows that the values increase as the frequency of the environment sound increases as well. </p>

                            <p>The additional task for 5000 level students was to blink the LED on the board when the microphone picks up a musical "C" note. As there are many "C" notes, different ranges were set for the microphone to pick up and flash the LED. The ranges are: 1. 250 ~ 266 2. 520 ~ 530 3. 125~135 4. 60~70 5. 1040~1050 </p>

                            <h4>Pre Lab</h4>
                            <p>For the second part of the lab, the pre lab was mostly downloading and verifying that the correct python, pip, and jupyter lab versions are correct and compatible. The codebase was provided in the lab instructions and told how to install the ArduinoBLE library. The very first step was to identify the MAC address and generate a new UUID for the board to avoid connecting to other people's board during the designated lab session. These values were then placed in their respective placed both in the arduino program and the jupyter lab (connection.yaml)</p>
                            <h4>Task 1 - ECHO</h4>
                            <p>For the first task, ECHO, the command was for the Artemis to send a string message to the laptop. A message "HiHello" was sent to the arduino and it should reply back with "Robot says -> HiHello". For the rest of this lab, arguments will be passed by triggering different cases. By using robot_cmd.get_next_value(), it is able to extract each character from the string. The results are displayed both on the serial monitor (Artemis board) and on jupyter lab (laptop).</p>

                            <h4>Task 2 - SEND_THREE_FLOATS</h4>
                            <p>For task 2, a new cmd needed to be created so it was first added onto the list in cmd_type and also on the arduino program. Adding a new cmd means a new case is being created. The SEND_THREE_FLOATS was quite similar to the SEND_TWO_INTS with the only difference being the data type being sent. The arduino needed to extract the float numbers being separated by "|".</p>

                            <p>Task 3 required us to add an additional cmd that would output the time by using the onboard timer function milis() then send it over bluetooth to the laptop. By appending the tx_estring_value like I did for the previous tasks. </p>

                            <p>In continuation of task 3, In the next task a notification handler was setup in python to extract the time whenever a string characteristic is received. In order to extract the time, ble.bytearray_to_string is used to turn the byte array into a string and split it after "T:". the value after the split is stored and sent back to the computer. </p>
                            <img src="img/1b_Task4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Task 5 - Loop</h4>
                            <p>In the next task, a new command was created called LOOP to send the time in a loop to observe the effective data transfer rate. Here 7 bytes were transferred per message for 5 seconds. On average there were around 35 messages per second. That means the effective transfer rate is 245 Bps</p>
                            <img src="img/1b_Task5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <h4>Task 6 - Time Array</h4>
                            <p>This task was to store all the time values in an array by first creating a new command, SEND_TIME_DATA. This command should fill the array until it is full and make sure it does not go beyond the array size. Then the array of time is sent to the computer and stored in a list using the notification handler. It can be seen that the list has a length of 250 which is the set size of the array. It seems like the transfer rate has increased drastially when stored in an array and sent.</p>

                            <h4>Task 7 - Temperature Array</h4>
                            <p>Task 7 was quite similar to the previous task. This time two arrays were created, one to store the time and one for the equivalent temperature from the sensor onboard. These arrays should match in size and can be mapped to the timestamps. It can be seen that when both were sent to the compute using the notification handler both have the same size of 250. </p>

                            <h4>Task 8 - Discussion</h4>
                            <p>These two methods both have advantages and disadvantages so we might need to chose either one depending on the scenario. By storing all values in an array before sending in a batch, it ensures a faster transmission speed and a higher effective transmission rate but there is a risk of the board running out of RAM. Since it only has 384kB of RAM, it is risky to be storing too many values in an array which may lead to a potential overflow. By choosing the second method to send data in real-time, it uses less RAM, therefore, elimiating the risk of causing memory overflow. There will not be much delay between collection and transmission time like the other method. However, if the data is collected too fast, the BLE might not be able to keep up which may lead to packet drops as shown in the previous tasks. There is also a higher risk of data loss since they are being sent one by one.</p>
                            <h4>5000 Task</h4>
                            <p>The results show that smaller sized bytes might have more overhead as the BLE setup time dominates transmission, and that results in a lower data rate. As the message size increases, the efficiency improves drastically, peakingat 100 bytes. This confirms that larger messages reduce overhead. </p>
                            <img src="img/5000Level_1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>In the reliability test, it seems like all the data went through no matter the change of rate however it does become slower causing some delays.</p>
                            <h4>Discussion</h4>
                            <p>In this lab, I learned the basics of BLE and how to use notification handlers. I was a bit confused about python and arduino and how the board transmitted and received data to the computer but by the end I understood it.</p>

This is the first piece that was connected to the board since starting the labs. After analyzing the IMU data and sending it across from the Artemis board to the laptop, I ran the stunt car for the first time and demonstrated some stunts.</p>

                            <p>For the pre-lab, we had to read about the IMU that we would be using in the lab and brush up on the knowledge taught during the lectures (Equations from the slides are going to be used later during the lab).</p>
                            <h4>Task 1 - Setup the IMU</h4>
                            <p>As part of the setup, the  “SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout_ICM 20948_Arduino Library” was installed and the simple example was ran to understand the basics of how the accelerometer works. </p>

                            <p>In this section, the accelerometer will be analyzed in depth by first converting the data into pitch and roll by using the equations shown in class. Jupyter labs was used to plot the graphs after the data was sent from the Artemis board. the video below demonstrates that the IMU is functional by observing the built-in serial plotter in arduino.</p>

                            <h4>Task 2 - Fourier Transform</h4>
                            <p>To implement the fourier transform for the accelerometer data, the linked website in the lab script was very helpful to find the sample rate and N which ultimately led to finding the cut off frequency after analyzing the graphs. The graphs below show the noisiness of the accelerometer just with gentle taps on the table. From the FFT graph, it can be deduced that the cut-off frequency should be set at around 5Hz. This value was used to later implement the RC lowp-pass filter as taught in class.</p>

                            <p>The code above is the implementation of the low-pass filter derived from the lecture notes. The lower two graphs show the results after applying the lowpass filter. The cut-off frequency was experimented with different values but 5Hz seemed to be the most effective in removing as much noise as possible. The noise reduces drastically after the 5Hz point on both pitch and roll as expected.</p>
                            <h3>Gyroscope</h3>
                            <p>In the next section, we moved to analyzing the outputs of the Gyroscope through a series of measurements and adding a complementary filter to integrate both the gyro and accelerometer values together.</p>
                            <h4>Task 1 - Gyroscope Pitch and Roll</h4>
                            <p></p>

                            </div>
                            <p>The gyro values were calculated with the help of the equations mentioned in the lecture slides and the code example. The values of the pitch and roll for gyro were the wrong way due to the difference in reference axis between the gyro and accelerometer. After flipping the pitch and roll, the gyro_roll gave an inverted result when compared to the accelerometer roll, therefore, a negative sign was assigned rather than positive as shown in the example. I am not entirely sure what could have caused the inverted gyro_roll values. As shown in the graph, the raw, filtered and the gyro_pitch are compared against each other. Gyro values clearly are not the most accurate and has drift.

                            <h2>Lab3: Time of Flight Sensors </h2>
                            <p>In Lab 3, we had to solder 2 ToF sensors and test the accuracy so when they are built onto the RC car that can be used to tell the distance.</p>
                            <ul class="list-inline item-details">
                            <h4>Pre Lab</h4>
                            <p>For the pre-lab, we had to read about the Time of Flight sendsors and take note of the I2C address because it would be used later on when dealing with 2 ToFs. We also had to think about the wiring and the placement of the compoenents that would end up going onto the RC car later on.</p>
                            <h3>Soldering</h3>
                            <h4>Task 1 - Battery</h4>
                            <p>In this section, we cut some of the JST connectors and soldered them together with the 750mAh battery to power the Artemis nano board. Later on, the board should be fully functional without having to connect it to the computer. We had to cut the ends off, slide heat shrinks on and solder them all together. The image below shows the board connecting to Bluetooth without connecting to the computer through a USB. I was able to transmit data and display it on the computer.</p>
                            <img src="img/Lab3/Battery.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="" style="max-width: 45%;> 

                            <p>After installing the SparkFun VL53L1X 4m laser distance sensor library, I was able to connec the QWIIC break-out board and start soldering the ToF sensors. Before soldering, we had to cut the QWIIC wire and match it to the corresponding pins on the ToF. The orientation is very important and I ended up making a mistake soldered the wires in the wrong direction for the two sensors. This has become a bit of an inconvenience during testing because it is harder to make sure both sensors are outputting similar values when the wires are in the way.</p>
                            <img src="img/Lab3/wired.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Task 2 - Mode selection and I2C address</h4>
                            <p>The first thing that was done in the section was to run the example "Example1_wire_I2C" and check whether the address matches the one we recorded during the prelab. As shown in the image below, the built-in address on the ToFs are 0x52 but it is showing 0x29. The reason behind this is because the least significant bit of the address is read/write making the built-in address 0x52. In binary, it can be seen that 0x29 has just been shifted left for the extra read/write bit.</p>

                            <p>The code above is the implementation of the low-pass filter derived from the lecture notes. The lower two graphs show the results after applying the lowpass filter. The cut-off frequency was experimented with different values but 5Hz seemed to be the most effective in removing as much noise as possible. The noise reduces drastically after the 5Hz point on both pitch and roll as expected.</p>
                            <h3>Gyroscope</h3>
                            <p>In the next section, we moved to analyzing the outputs of the Gyroscope through a series of measurements and adding a complementary filter to integrate both the gyro and accelerometer values together.</p>
                            <h4>Task 1 - Gyroscope Pitch and Roll</h4>
                            <p></p>
                            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

                            </div>
                            <p>The gyro values were calculated with the help of the equations mentioned in the lecture slides and the code example. The values of the pitch and roll for gyro were the wrong way due to the difference in reference axis between the gyro and accelerometer. After flipping the pitch and roll, the gyro_roll gave an inverted result when compared to the accelerometer roll, therefore, a negative sign was assigned rather than positive as shown in the example. I am not entirely sure what could have caused the inverted gyro_roll values. As shown in the graph, the raw, filtered and the gyro_pitch are compared against each other. Gyro values clearly are not the most accurate and has drift. A common observation when tweaking with the values is that the gyroscope may start deviating and end up in completely differnt end points than the accelerometer values.</p>

                            <h4>Task 2 - Complimentary filter</h4>
                            <p>The complimentary filter integrates both the accelerometer and the gyroscope values with the tuning of the alpha value. This reduces the drift from the gyroscope and filters out noise from the accelerometer data. The roll graph is a perfect example where the gyroscope values are deviated and contains drift, and the accelerometer values are quite noisy but the complimentary filter is smoother.</p>

                            <p>For this part, I created two cases, one to start gathering data and one to send the data back to the computer.

On the left, this snippet is part of the main loop when the data for pitch, roll, and gyro values are stored in their individual arrays for better management.
